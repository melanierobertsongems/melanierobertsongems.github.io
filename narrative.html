		<h1>STUDS TURKEL INSPIRED NARRATIVE</h1>
		<p> A narrative I wrote from the perspective of a profesional route setter. I interviewed Dave Decelles about his profession as a routesetter and used his responses to write a narrative, non-fiction piece from Dave's perspective. This piece was inspired by the book "Working" by Studs Terkel, a famous chicago radio inerviewer. In Working, "people Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do". Terkel conducts many interviews and writes narratives about chicagoans from this. Inspiration for my narrative come from Turkel's Working.</p>
